"""Plan upload + Claude Vision analysis endpoints.

Every failure mode is mapped to a specific German error message and a
sensible HTTP status code. The frontend relies on the status code to
decide what to show (upgrade banner for 403, validation hint for 400,
generic retry for 5xx) and on ``detail`` for the exact text. We never
raise a bare 500 with an opaque message — the analysis endpoint
surfaces ``PlanAnalysisError.detail`` directly so the user always sees
something actionable.
